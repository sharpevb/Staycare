## The What

*StayCare is an electronic management system for small, in-home daycare providers. StayCare allows the provider to edit and display a child's daily activities throughout the day and can send email and text message (SMS/MMS) updates throughout the day to a child's parents or to all families. Meanwhile, parents can view their child's daily report in real-time and have a profile page where they can easily edit and update their contact information.*

## The Why
The primary goal of StayCare is to help assist small, in-home daycare providers securely move into the digital age! Our app gives providers the ability to streamline daily processes by being able to fill out digital daily reports to parents rather than taking the time to fill out paper forms for each child. It also has the capability for providers to digitally send updates to parents throughout the day to ease any anxiety parents may have.
